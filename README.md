## Utvikling

### Introduction
In this section, you will find code examples for the Node.js language, coded with the modules Express and HBS. Node.js is a popular back-end language used to create web applications, and Express is a framework that makes it easier to develop web applications with Node.js. HBS is a templating engine used with Express that allows for easier handling of HTML templates.

### Links
If you're new to Node.js and Express, I recommend checking out these resources for an introduction to the language and framework:

- [The Node.js official documentation](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/)
